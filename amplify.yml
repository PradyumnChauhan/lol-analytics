# Note: For API routes with long timeouts (15 minutes), ensure that:
# 1. The route has maxDuration = 900 (15 minutes) configured (see src/app/api/ai/dashboard-insights/route.ts)
# 2. AWS Amplify Lambda function timeout is configured to at least 15 minutes in the AWS Console
# 3. Amplify's API Gateway timeout may need to be increased through AWS Console or CloudFormation
